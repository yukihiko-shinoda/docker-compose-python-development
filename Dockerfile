# GCP credential source for gws: activates the claude-code service account's
# static JSON key (Docker secret, minted by gcp-agent-key.sh, mounted at
# /opt/claude-agent-secrets/claude-code-key.json -- see compose.yml) with
# gcloud, mints a short-lived GCP OAuth token scoped to Drive/Docs from it,
# then execs into the real gws binary (renamed to gws-real above) with that
# token. Installed AT /usr/local/bin/gws itself (shadowing the real binary),
# not under a separate name like gws-agent, so Claude Code calls the bare
# `gws <service> <resource> <method> --params/--json ...` interface exactly
# as documented by `gws --help`/`gws schema`, with credential injection
# invisible to it. See terraform-google-personal's service_accounts.tf for
# the claude-code service account, and CLAUDE.md for the full chain. gcloud
# stays installed above for this token-minting step even though this wrapper
# no longer uses it for WIF impersonation (see the wrapper's own comments).
# A WIF credential-config JSON for the same fallback path may exist locally
# at ./google-wif-cred-config.json on a given host, but it's gitignored, not
# committed (it names this GCP project's number and the claude-code service
# account's email, which the account owner doesn't want in version control,
# even though the file holds no credential itself) -- regenerate it with
# `gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create-cred-config` (see
# terraform-google-personal/service_accounts.tf's comment above the
# claude_code WIF IAM policy binding) if that fallback path is ever revived.
